The changes to our budget are as follows:
(Can we list amounts for each of these changes?)

\begin{itemize}
  \item [largest change] Reducing the summer support to 1--1.4 summer months per faculty
  \item Reducing the amount of Ph.D. student support by 9 months (I'm not sure
    if this is true, but perhaps this still supports students for the full
    year, except for three years where we anticipate students have internships)
  \item Trimming a little bit of funding from materials and supplies.
\end{itemize}

Keep:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Section 3.2: observational studies
  \item Section 4.1, 4.2: core PL
  \item Section 3.1, 3.2, 7: core HCI
  \item Section 4.3: evaluation
  \item Section 5.3: [another target to drop]
  \item \ldots{} everything else
\end{itemize}

Drop:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Section 5.2: pattern language for logs
  \item Section 3.1: just the second survey
  \item Section 7.2: When to Specify It!
\end{itemize}
