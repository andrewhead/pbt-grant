\section*{Facilities, Equipments, \& other Resources}

Penn's departmental computing facilities include a standard collection of
networking services, printers, fileservers, and compute servers.  No
specialized facilities or equipment will be needed to carry out the
proposed work.

\hg{Any chance we want to budget for a new machine for someone (e.g., one or
more of the potential other PhD students)? Or is that priced in?}

\bcp{Good catch -- yes, we want to budget for new machines for all.
  Possibly also a server, for running lots of tests faster...}

\bcp{We should give high-ish priority to the budget stuff, as this
  will require some back and forth with PEFS.}

\hg{Other things off the top of my head then: travel for speaking, meetings, and
conferences (lots), REPL funding (talking to Joey next week), desk setups for
the new students, a bit of money for hosting PBT-focused PLClub speakers? ---
I'm just guessing at stuff, just take the parts that make sense}
