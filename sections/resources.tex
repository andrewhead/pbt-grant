\section*{Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources}

Penn's departmental computing facilities include a standard collection of
networking services, printers, fileservers, and compute servers.  No
specialized facilities or equipment will be needed to carry out the
proposed work.

\bcp{Talk about the server machine (use text from the budget justification)}

\todo{Mention, here, any machines we've budgeted for in the budget
  section?}

\hg{Other things off the top of my head then: travel for speaking, meetings, and
conferences (lots), REPL funding (talking to Joey next week), desk setups for
the new students, a bit of money for hosting PBT-focused PLClub speakers? ---
I'm just guessing at stuff, just take the parts that make sense}

\discuss{
Document all three (four?) unfunded external collaborations.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Any substantial collaboration with individuals not included in
  the budget should be described in the Facilities, Equipment and
  Other Resources section of the proposal (see Chapter II.D.2.g) and
  documented in a letter of collaboration from each collaborator. Such
  letters should be provided in the supplementary documentation
  section of Research.gov and follow the format instructions specified
  in Chapter II.D.2.i.
  \item We also need to make sure that the appropriate sections of the
  project description mention the collaborations.
  \end{itemize}
