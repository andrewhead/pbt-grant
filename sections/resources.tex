\section*{Facilities, Equipments, \& other Resources}

Penn's departmental computing facilities include a standard collection of
networking services, printers, fileservers, and compute servers.  No
specialized facilities or equipment will be needed to carry out the
proposed work.  
\hg{Any chance we want to budget for a new machine for someone (e.g., one or
more of the potential other PhD students)? Or is that priced in?}
