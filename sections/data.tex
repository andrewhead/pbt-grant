\section*{Data Management Plan}

\todo{GPG: In the interest of completeness and transparency, PIs must
  describe, as part of their Data Management Plans, how they will
  provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or
  simulation tools, and code bases to support
  reproducibility/replicability of their methods and results for a
  reasonable time beyond the end of the project lifecycle.  (Check this!)} 

The proposed project will produce two types of data: (1) software artifacts,
including implementations, test cases, software revision histories, and
other items; and (2) technical papers and talks describing our experiences
and results.

All software artifacts will be distributed under an open-source
license.  They will be documented so as to allow others to understand,
use, and modify them.  (Both PIs have extensive records of
distributing artifacts in this way.)  Artifacts will be made available
to the public on Github and maintained for at least three years beyond
the end of the project lifecycle.

Technical papers will be published in academic conferences and journals.
Drafts will be made available on Arxiv.
