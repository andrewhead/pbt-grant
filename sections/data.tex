\section*{Data Management Plan}

The project will produce four types of data.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Software artifacts,
including implementations, test cases, software revision histories, and
other items.  These will be distributed under an open-source
license.  They will be documented so as to allow others to understand,
use, and modify them.  (Both PIs have extensive records of
distributing artifacts in this way.)  Artifacts will be made available
to the public on Github and maintained for at least three years beyond
the end of the project lifecycle.

\item Technical papers and talks describing our experiences
and results.  These will be published in academic conferences and journals.
Drafts will be made available on Arxiv.

\item Educational materials aimed at undergraduates, masters students,
and professional developers, which will be made available on the
project's public website under an open-source license.

\item Raw data gathered during user studies, which will be kept
confidential and stored securely in accordance with IRB-approved best
practices.
\end{enumerate}
