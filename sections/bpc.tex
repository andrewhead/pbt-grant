\section*{Broadening Participation in Computing}

\subsection*{1. Departmental BPC Plan}

The Computer and Information Science Department at the University of
Pennsylvania is in the final stages of developing a department-wide
BPC plan, which will be submitted to BPCnet for verification in the
new year.  This section summarizes the current draft plan, which the
current PIs are helping shape.

\subsection*{Context}

The University of Pennsylvania is a private, Ivy League research university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Undergraduate admission is highly selective, with 9\% of applicants admitted in 2020. The table below presents some data on the demographics of the undergraduate population of the CIS Department in 2016 and in 2021, comparing the percentage of majors who identify as women and historically under-represented minorities (URM) in computer science, namely as Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, or Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. Data for the entire undergraduate population of the university, and from the Taulbee survey of US and Canadian computer science departments, are also presented as points of comparison.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
  population & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{women} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{URM}
\\
\hline
  & 2016 & 2021 & 2016 & 2021
\\
\hline
Penn overall &
50.2\% &
53.6\% &
17.7\% &
18.2\%
\\
Penn CIS &
14.8\% &
27.9\% &
5.9\% &
9.4\%
\\
Taulbee &
17.9\% &
22.3\% &
11.1\% &
12.7\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The CIS Department is above the Taulbee averages of other CS departments in terms of gender diversity, though it lags far behind Penn as a whole. In URM representation, the department unfortunately trails both the Taulbee averages and the rest of the university, though these gaps have narrowed since 2016 even as the department has undergone substantial growth in enrollment from 169 graduating seniors in 2016 to 297 students in 2021.

\subsection*{Goals}

We identify four key goals for the department to continue to improve diversity among undergraduate student, graduate student and faculty populations.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Increase diversity of undergraduate students, demonstrating year on year improvements toward matching and then exceeding national averages.
\item
Increase diversity of graduate students, demonstrating year on year improvements toward matching and then exceeding national averages.
\item
Increase diversity of faculty, demonstrating year on year improvements toward matching and then exceeding national averages.
\item
Enhance local area CS pipeline with K-12 outreach.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Activities and Measurement}

\paragraph*{Goal 1: Undergraduate Student Diversity}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Activity: Support participation in conferences such as Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing, Capitol WIC, (Bhusnurmath, Sheth)
\item Activity: Hold regular department-wide Diversity Summits to discuss representation and solicit feedback. Recent Diversity Summit feedback has led to greater transparency in TA hiring.
\item Activity: Engage undergraduate researchers through Center for Undergraduate Research \& Fellowships, summer visiting scholar positions and NSF REUs.
\item Measurement: Evaluate representation in the major with particular emphasis on entry and retention statistics in the introductory CS courses.
\item Measurement: Evaluate number of undergraduate researchers hosted with particular emphasis on their success in the major as well as their applications and matriculations to graduate school. Evaluate the number of faculty hosting undergraduate researchers.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Goal 2: Graduate Student Diversity}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Activity: Better promote fellowships to faculty. Leverage internal opportunities like Fontaine Fellowships for recruiting PhD students from underrepresented groups
\item Activity: Allow more flexibility on PhD milestone exams to support students from diverse backgrounds with heterogeneous preparation.
\item Activity: Graduate student mentoring workshops like Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop, Women in Theory, Young Architect Workshop (Angel, Devietti, Pierce, Rabin, Weirich, Zdancewic)
\item Measurement: Evaluate the number of graduate students participating in workshops and conferences that celebrate diversity.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Goal 3: Faculty Diversity}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Activity: Engage with EECS Rising Stars and NSF CI Fellows by (a) encouraging Pennâ€™s graduate students to apply, (b) encouraging faculty candidates from these programs to apply to Penn's searches.
\item Activity: Diversify symposium and seminar speakers.
\item Measurement: Evaluate demographics of faculty applications, short-lists, interviews, and offers. Establish baselines for assessing year-over-year improvement.
\item Measurement: Evaluate demographics of seminar speakers.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Goal 4: Improve K-12 Outreach}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Activity: Fife Academy provides CS education in K-8 schools
\item Activity: Steppingstone Scholars Blended Learning Initiative offers summer programming camp for 6th-12th grade students
\item Activity: After-school and summer courses preparing for AP CS A exam (Fouh)
\item Activity: Tech It Out Philly high school coding workshops (Haeberlen)
\item Activity: WICS High School Day for Girls
\item Measurement: monitor number of participating Philadelphia and Penn students
\item Measurement: track AP CS A exam results
\end{enumerate}
