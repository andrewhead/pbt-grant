\discuss{Do we want to try to refocus the summary like we did the
  intro?  I'd say it's worthwhile, if possible.}

\amh{John thinks we need to better emphasize reflective generators as a key idea
in the proposal. Can we do something about that here and in the introduction?}

\summarysection{Overview}
Property-based testing (PBT) is an advanced software engineering
methodology where users write executable formal specifications of system
components
and an automated harness checks these specifications against
many automatically generated inputs.  The bug-finding power of PBT
stems from its ability to express rich specifications that
exercise a wide range of system behaviors---both
expected and unexpected---with minimal user guidance.
%
From its roots in the Haskell QuickCheck library, PBT has become
the testing method of choice across much of the functional programming
community; it has also begun to make inroads into industrial practice
at companies such as Amazon, Volvo, Stripe, Galois, and IOG.
%
The goal of this proposal is to accelerate this transition
by addressing key challenges in
PBT.

What are these challenges? 
In an ongoing need-finding study of PBT at Jane
Street, a Wall Street trading firm which uses its software
technology as a competitive advantage, we find developers enthusiastic
about its {\em usefulness} but frustrated with its {\em usability}.
%
Indeed, this study has identified usability as an issue in both major aspects
of PBT methods---{\em specification} of properties and {\em
  generation} of random inputs. Moreover, it reveals other challenges
around another aspect of PBT that has so far received less research
attention: how programmers {\em interact} with their programming
environment during the testing process.

% At the level of {\em specification}, developers wished for better
% support for expressing common requirements such as ``this
% high-performance implementation of a service must behave exactly the
% same as that reference model'' and for articulating properties of
% poorly modularized code.
% %
% Concerning the other main component of PBT, the {\em generation} of
% random test cases, \todo{...}
% %
% Developers also need better {\em validation} tools for checking
% that their testing is actually effective.\todo{blah}
% %
% Finally, better {\em education} of potential PBT users is critically
% required.

% \amh{How about the following framing? In this project, we define a practice of
% usable property-based testing, and conduct foundational research in PL and HCI
% to bring about this practice. We define usable property based-testing as having
% two main components. First, providing visibility into what can be extremely
% complex test outcomes. Second, supporting the efficient expression of
% tests.\ldots{} And then we can jump into talking about the challenges that we
% plan to solve in specification, generation, validation, and education.}.

% tests to minimal counterexamples,

To address these challenges and establish PBT as a mainstream
testing method, insights from two distinct research areas must be
brought to bear.
On one hand, PBT itself is grounded in domain-specific languages and
formal methods---topics traditionally associated with Programming
Languages and included in the Software and Hardware Foundations
program under CISE-CCF.  Usability, on the other hand, is the domain
of Human-Computer Interaction; its center of mass in CISE is IIS's
Human-Centered Computing program.
%
This five-year project will combine insights, methods, and tools from
PL and HCI to advance the usability of PBT along all three of its
axes---specification, generation, and interaction\iflater\todo{We may
  need to reorder these, depending on what happens with the global
  structure.}\fi---and bring it to a
broad community of students and software developers.

\summarysection{Intellectual Merit}
\hg{Joe thinks this could really use a rewrite}
The project will advance knowledge along four
\iflater \hg{NIT: We just said three axes above}\bcp{And how do they
  relate to ``themes''??} \fi
interconnected axes.
%
First, it will establish a firm \thread{foundation} for HCI-informed
research on PBT, supplementing our past and ongoing user studies with
broader surveys of PBT across the software industry, real-time
observations of developers interacting with PBT, and a novel cognitive
theory of PBT.
%
Second, it will explore a novel abstraction for random input \thread{
generation} that enables a range of use cases---generating inputs
satisfying validity conditions, reducing test-cases to smaller ones for easier
debugging,
mutating inputs to explore program behavior,
and manually or automatically tuning a random
generator's distribution based on examples or code coverage. We will also
explore further opportunities for automating the process of input test 
generation and develop benchmarks for evaluating those and other tools.
%
Third, it will offer developers more usable \thread{specification} tools,
including a language for stating temporal properties over internal
program states, mixed-initiative interactions for defining properties,
automation for model-based testing of
modular abstractions, and techniques for more easily explaining properties and
their implications.
%
And fourth, it will develop new tools for effective \thread{
interaction} between developers and their tests, including tools for
visualizing generated data
distributions, tuning data distributions, simplifying test-cases, and saving
  failing test-cases as understandable unit tests, culminating in a
  comprehensive development environment for PBT.

\summarysection{Broader Impacts}
A final thread of activity, coordinated with the rest and integral to the
project's aims, will
%
be to drive the \thread{diffusion} of PBT tools and
methodologies from academia into industry through targeted engineering effort
and a broad range of educational activities.
We will support and strengthen existing
open-source PBT tools in popular programming languages and enrich their
capabilities with well engineered research products from the four
themes described above;
%
and we will
develop materials for teaching industry programmers how to identify
high-leverage situations for using PBT and curricula for teaching mature
and powerful PBT practices to undergraduate\bcp{and masters?!} students. \amh{Comment from Elena:
``and graduate students''? Which makes me think, should we add modules to
software foundations or other graduate-level courses for
property-based testing?} \bcp{Not 5000, but definitely MSE courses!}
%
% \iflater
% A general-audience article on PBT for CACM will help broaden the
% its reach.\iflater\bcp{I think that's too detailed for the
%   summary?}\fi
% \fi

Work on the project will include and elevate undergraduate
researchers, including some from diverse backgrounds that will be
identified and supported through cooperation with a recently funded NSF-REU effort
at Penn. These undergraduates will work closely with the project's two
PIs, four Ph.D.{} students, and staff engineer.

The ultimate goal, to be achieved through education, publications, and open-source
tools, is to make property-based testing a standard tool on every
software developer's testing toolbelt.  Better testing, in turn, will
lead to software systems of every description that are less expensive, more
robust, and more reliable.


% The statement on broader impacts should describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
