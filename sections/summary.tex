\summarysection{Overview}
Property-based testing (PBT) is an advanced software engineering
methodology in which users write executable formal specifications of system
components
and an automated harness checks these specifications against
many automatically generated inputs.  The bug-finding power of PBT
stems from its ability to express rich specifications and to
exercise a wide range of system behaviors---both
expected and unexpected---with minimal user guidance.
%
From its roots in Haskell's QuickCheck library, PBT has become
the testing method of choice across much of the functional programming
community, and it is making inroads into industrial practice
at companies such as Amazon, Volvo, Stripe, Galois, and IOG.
%
The goal of this proposal is to accelerate this transition
by addressing key challenges.

What are these challenges?
In a recent need-finding study of professional software developers who
use PBT in their work, we
found people enthusiastic
about the {\em usefulness} of PBT but frustrated with its {\em usability}.
%
Indeed, this study identified usability as an issue in both major components
of PBT methods---the {\em specification} of properties and the {\em
  generation} of random inputs. Moreover, it reveals other challenges
around another aspect of PBT that has so far received less
attention from the research community: how programmers {\em interact}
with their PBT tools during the testing process.

% At the level of {\em specification}, developers wished for better
% support for expressing common requirements such as ``this
% high-performance implementation of a service must behave exactly the
% same as that reference model'' and for articulating properties of
% poorly modularized code.
% %
% Concerning the other main component of PBT, the {\em generation} of
% random test cases, \todo{...}
% %
% Developers also need better {\em validation} tools for checking
% that their testing is actually effective.\todo{blah}
% %
% Finally, better {\em education} of potential PBT users is critically
% required.

% \amh{How about the following framing? In this project, we define a practice of
% usable property-based testing, and conduct foundational research in PL and HCI
% to bring about this practice. We define usable property based-testing as having
% two main components. First, providing visibility into what can be extremely
% complex test outcomes. Second, supporting the efficient expression of
% tests.\ldots{} And then we can jump into talking about the challenges that we
% plan to solve in specification, generation, validation, and education.}.

To establish PBT as a mainstream software
testing method, insights from two distinct research areas must be
brought to bear.
On one side, PBT itself is grounded in domain-specific languages and
formal methods---topics traditionally associated with Programming
Languages and included in the SHF
program under CISE-CCF.  Usability, on the other hand, is the domain
of Human-Computer Interaction; its center of mass in CISE is IIS's
HCC program.  This collaborative proposal brings together
experts in both areas, aiming to create new PBT tools
offering users unprecedented levels of visibility and control.

\summarysection{Intellectual Merit}
The project will advance knowledge along four
interconnected axes.
%
First, it will establish a firm \thread{foundation} for HCI-informed
research on PBT, supplementing past user studies with
broader surveys of PBT across the software industry and real-time
observations of developers interacting with PBT.
%
Second, it will explore a new abstraction for random input
\thread{generation} that enables a range of novel use
cases---generating inputs satisfying validity conditions and tuning
distributions based on examples or coverage. It
will also explore automatic generator construction and develop
benchmarks for PBT tools.
%
Third, it will offer developers more usable \thread{specification} tools,
including a language for temporal properties over program traces,
automatic model-based testing of
modular abstractions, and a programmer's assistant that brings together
specification generation techniques and contemporary AI to help programmers
imagine and implement properties.
%
And fourth, it will develop new tools for effective
\thread{interaction} between developers and their tests, focusing on
tools for visualizing and manipulating generated data
distributions and culminating in a first-of-its-kind interactive IDE for PBT.

\summarysection{Broader Impacts}
A final thread of activity, coordinated with the rest and integral to the
project's aims,
is supporting the \thread{diffusion} of PBT tools and
methodologies from academia into industry through collaboration with
industry leaders and through a range of educational activities.
We will
develop materials for teaching industry programmers how to identify
high-leverage PBT opportunities and curricula for teaching mature
and powerful PBT practices to undergraduate and master's students.
And we will transition our interactive IDE for PBT from a research
prototype into an open-source project with active users and
contributors in multiple organizations.

Work on the project will include and elevate a group of undergraduate
researchers from
diverse backgrounds that will be identified and supported through
a recently funded NSF-REU effort at Penn. These
undergraduates will work closely with the PIs and Ph.D.{} students.

% \amh{This is a place where our wording might be too ``engineering'' focused
% rather than ``research'' focused. Can we instead state our ultimate goal as
% research insight that clarifies and diminishes the gap between theory and
% practice for property-based testing?}

\smallskip

The ultimate goal, through novel research, education, publications, and open-source
tooling, is to advance the state of the art in property-based testing
and put it on every
software developer's testing toolbelt.
\hg{+1 to the comments below---I think we cut it here}
Better testing, in turn, will
lead to software systems that are more robust and less expensive.
\amh{Here is an opportunity to restate
the ``something impressive'' from the overview.}
\bcp{Yes.  Or something, at any rate, that lands with less of a thud.
E.g., simply deleting that last sentence might be OK.  :-)}

% The statement on broader impacts should describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
