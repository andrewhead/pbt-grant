\section*{Management and Coordination Plan \pagebudget{3}}\label{appendix:coord}

\ifnext
\todo{GPG: a Large proposal must define the roles of all members of
  the team and the synergies among them in a Management and
  Coordination plan (3-page limit, to be submitted as a Supplementary
  Document). This plan should include: 1) the specific roles of the
  PI, co-PIs, other senior personnel, and paid consultants at all
  organizations involved to demonstrate that the project personnel
  have distinct but complementary expertise; 2) how the project will
  be managed within or across organizations, including how team
  coordination will be evaluated; 3) the methods, measures, and/or
  metrics related to how the team will evaluate technical milestones,
  and their impact on the project; 4) identification of the specific
  coordination mechanisms that will enable cross-organization and/or
  cross-expertise scientific integration and achieve synergy within
  the team; and 5) pointers to the budget line items that support
  these management and coordination mechanisms.}

\todo{GPG: The length and level of detail provided in the Plan should
  be commensurate with the complexity of the proposed project and
  should include any proposed collaboration with industry and
  international partners, and any other unpaid collaborators on the
  project.}

\todo{Management and Coordination Plans and proposed budgets should
  demonstrate that key personnel, and especially lead PIs, have
  allocated adequate time for both their individual technical
  contributions and the leadership of collaborative activities
  necessary to realize the synergistic effects of larger-scale
  research.}

\todo{Webinar: Management and Coordination plan should include
  complementarity of expertise, etc.}

\todo{Make sure we explain in a few places how much work these studies
are!}

Key personnel for this work will include the two co-PIs, four PhD
students with varying background and interests, one staff engineer,
and several advanced undergraduate and Master's students.  The work of
the project will take place over the course of five years.

Figure~\ref{fig:workplan} sketches our envisaged mapping of tasks onto
PhD dissertations, with a rough timeline indicating a natural ordering
of the tasks.  Figure~\ref{fig:roles} provides more detail on
supporting effort and supervision.

\forreaders{This section needs more text, but we've worked pretty hard
on the tables.  Your feedback is appreciated!}

\ROLE{Ph.D. 1}{Advisor PI Head}{Foundations}{The first Ph.D. student will 
develop foundational knowledge to support the human-centered design and 
development of PBT tools. This work will begin with defining a preliminary 
theory of PBT on the basis of our studies to date, with a set of falsifiable 
hypotheses about how tooling supports PBT. Then, the student will conduct a 
survey to expand and generalize our understanding of barriers, conduct critical 
comparative studies of existing PBT solutions, and assist in the conduct of 
formative observational studies related to tool-building efforts.}{Qualitative 
HCI}

\ROLE{Ph.D. 2}{Advisor PI Pierce}{Generation}{The second Ph.D.  
student
will develop the PL theory necessary to enable new classes of powerful PBT 
generation tools. Central to this Ph.D. will be the advancement of work on 
reflective generators, a powerful abstraction for producing random data, with 
potential to support tunability of distributions and sophisticated shrinking 
techniques. This student will also develop a benchmark suite supporting the 
head-to-head comparison of PBT technologies developed in PL. Further efforts 
will involve the assessment of the usability of reflective output with the 
assistance of HCI Ph.D. student 1, and the improvement of language design for 
generator automation.}{PL Theory}

\ROLE{Ph.D. 3}{Advisor PI Pierce}{Specification}{The third Ph.D. student 
will advance programming languages for specification. Their goal will be to 
enhance the expressiveness and understandability of specifications. Their work 
will begin by making specification languages more powerful by supporting 
formulation of properties across module boundaries, and the more efficient 
specification of model-based properties. They will then explore how to improve 
the walk-up-and-use experience of specification languages by building tools for 
mixed-initiative property specification and understanding the meaning of 
properties. Their work will conclude with developing technology for for 
converting between property-based specifications into singular test-case 
specifications to serve as regression tests.}{PL Language Design}

\ROLE{Ph.D. 4}{Advisor PI Head}{Interaction}{The fourth Ph.D. student 
will design, implement, and evaluate interactive views that provide programmers 
with powerful controls for influencing testing effectiveness. They will first 
develop tools that support the live viewing and analysis of complex 
distributions of generated data. Then, drawing on the reflective generator 
technology developed by Ph.D. 2, they will introduce controls that allow 
programmers to influence the behavior of generators through direct manipulation 
of generated data. The Ph.D.  student will also design tools that support the 
understanding of individual inputs with novel features for interactive shrinking 
and debugging. Select views will be brought together and refined to make testing 
dashboards suitable for monitoring the outcomes of random PBT tests in 
professional software development
settings.}{HCI Systems}

% \ROLE{PhD 1}{Advisor PI Pierce}{Reflecting on Random Generation}{This PhD student will focus on reflective generators, a powerful abstraction for producing random data. They will finish developing the theoretical abstraction and then continue by working closely with our staff engineer to implement and evaluate testing tools that rely on reflective generators as a foundation. This student will also work with undergraduate students to implement orthogonal testing tools.}{PL, Some HCI}

% \ROLE{PhD 2}{Advisor PI Head}{Human-Centered Foundations of Property-Based Testing}{This PhD student will develop a robust theory of property-based testing from a user-centered perspective. They will start by finishing ongoing work with Jane Street. Then they will do further foundational studies to understand finer-grained aspects of PBT usability and make recommendations for the design of future PBT tools and curricula.}{HCI, Some PL}

% \ROLE{PhD 3}{Advisors PI Head and PI Pierce}{"In Your Face" Property-Based Testing}{This PhD student will build tools for PBT that integrate the testing process into a programmer's editing environment. They will use human-centered methods to design and implement tools that users will actually see value in, and they will significantly increase the potential adoption of PBT by putting it easily within reach.}{HCI, PL}

% \ROLE{PhD 4}{Advisors PI Head and PI Pierce}{Teaching Lightweight Formal Methods}{This PhD student will approach PBT from the perspective of an educator, asking how students and industry professionals can better succeed at learning to use the tools involved. They will develop curricula for teaching PBT, and they will also ask more fundamental questions about how users understand executable properties. This work will dove-tail with ongoing work at Penn about human-centered aspects of other kinds of properties (e.g., theorems in proof assistants).}{Education, Some PL, Some HCI}

\subsection*{Research Engineer}

\ROLE{Engineer}{Supervisors PI Head and PI Pierce}{Property-Based Testing in the Wild}{Many of the aforementioned projects include or would benefit from technology transfer activities that bring research ideas into practice. Our staff engineer will assist with this transfer, interfacing with existing open source communities to maintain, improve, and popularize frameworks for PBT in a number of popular programming languages. This will include, but not be limited to: implementing reflective generators in existing frameworks, improving library designs as per recommendations from PhD 2, maintaining the tools produced by PhD 3, etc.}{Engineering}

\subsection*{Timeline}

\underconstruction{Here we will discuss the timeline shown in the
  figure in more detail}

\iflater
\todo{The following needs to be adjusted to fit the new timeline and people.}

Early efforts will focus on strengthening foundations, strengthening and
generalizing the findings from our need-finding research to-date. Then, beginning in
year 1, we will develop PL techniques for which we have strong
motivation, and which will form the backbone of later interactive systems. This
includes the development of reflective generators, shrinkers, and fuzzers.
Initially, these efforts will be led by PhD candidate Harrison Goldstein, who
has developed the preliminary work in these areas cited in the proposal.

HCI-based tool-building will begin in earnest in year 2, once the
foundations have been established. This will take place in parallel with observations
of developers undertaking PBT for the particular tasks the tools are meant to
support. Some of these projects, most notably the ability to tune data
distributions, will require tight coordination between the PL and HCI student.
Other projects, including tooling for evaluating data distributions and and
counterexamples as regression tests, are less tightly coupled.

Educational initiatives will take place throughout the project. PBT
instruction will be incorporated into the data science classroom in the
first year, and iteratively improved after reviewing course outcomes in each
successive year. Our efforts to teach developers when to leverage properties will
occur mostly in the first two years in parallel with our formative
research. Tool-building for the classroom will take place in the final two
years, after we have established a strong instructional core for teaching PBT at
Penn.
