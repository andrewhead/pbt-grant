\section*{Management and Coordination Plan \pagebudget{3}}

\todo{GPG: a Large proposal must define the roles of all members of
  the team and the synergies among them in a Management and
  Coordination plan (3-page limit, to be submitted as a Supplementary
  Document). This plan should include: 1) the specific roles of the
  PI, co-PIs, other senior personnel, and paid consultants at all
  organizations involved to demonstrate that the project personnel
  have distinct but complementary expertise; 2) how the project will
  be managed within or across organizations, including how team
  coordination will be evaluated; 3) the methods, measures, and/or
  metrics related to how the team will evaluate technical milestones,
  and their impact on the project; 4) identification of the specific
  coordination mechanisms that will enable cross-organization and/or
  cross-expertise scientific integration and achieve synergy within
  the team; and 5) pointers to the budget line items that support
  these management and coordination mechanisms.}

\todo{GPG: The length and level of detail provided in the Plan should
  be commensurate with the complexity of the proposed project and
  should include any proposed collaboration with industry and
  international partners, and any other unpaid collaborators on the
  project.} 

\todo{Management and Coordination Plans and proposed budgets should
  demonstrate that key personnel, and especially lead PIs, have
  allocated adequate time for both their individual technical
  contributions and the leadership of collaborative activities
  necessary to realize the synergistic effects of larger-scale
  research.} 

\todo{Webinar: Management and Coordination plan should include
  complementarity of expertise, etc.}

\noindent
The work of this project will take place over the course
of four years (Figure~\ref{fig:workplan}). All projects will constitute
collaborative efforts involving both PIs, though individual projects will align
more or less strongly with the themes of PL
(advised by PI Pierce, highlighted in blue) and HCI (advised
by PI Head, highlighted in yellow). Key personnel for this work will include the
co-PIs, one PhD student trained primarily in PL, one trained primarily in HCI,
and many
advanced undergraduate and Master's students.

Early efforts will focus on strengthening foundations, strengthening and
generalizing the findings from our need-finding research to-date. Then, beginning in
year 1, we will develop PL techniques for which we have strong
motivation, and which will form the backbone of later interactive systems. This
includes the development of reflective generators, shrinkers, and fuzzers.
Initially, these efforts will be led by PhD candidate Harrison Goldstein, who
has developed the preliminary work in these areas cited in the proposal.

HCI-based tool-building will begin in earnest in year 2, once the
foundations have been established. This will take place in parallel with observations
of developers undertaking PBT for the particular tasks the tools are meant to
support. Some of these projects, most notably the ability to tune data
distributions, will require tight coordination between the PL and HCI student.
Other projects, including tooling for evaluating data distributions and and
counterexamples as regression tests, are less tightly coupled.

Educational initiatives will take place throughout the project. PBT
instruction will be incorporated into the data science classroom in the
first year, and iteratively improved after reviewing course outcomes in each
successive year. Our efforts to teach developers when to leverage properties will
occur mostly in the first two years in parallel with our formative
research. Tool-building for the classroom will take place in the final two
years, after we have established a strong instructional core for teaching PBT at
Penn.
