\todo{Just double check...}
\todo{GPG: The length and level of detail provided in the Plan should
  be commensurate with the complexity of the proposed project and
  should include any proposed collaboration with industry and
  international partners, and any other unpaid collaborators on the
  project.}
\todo{GPG: a Large proposal must define the roles of all members of
  the team and the synergies among them in a Management and
  Coordination plan (3-page limit, to be submitted as a Supplementary
  Document). This plan should include: 1) the specific roles of the
  PI, co-PIs, other senior personnel, and paid consultants at all
  organizations involved to demonstrate that the project personnel
  have distinct but complementary expertise; 2) how the project will
  be managed within or across organizations, including how team
  coordination will be evaluated; 3) the methods, measures, and/or
  metrics related to how the team will evaluate technical milestones,
  and their impact on the project; 4) identification of the specific
  coordination mechanisms that will enable cross-organization and/or
  cross-expertise scientific integration and achieve synergy within
  the team; and 5) pointers to the budget line items that support
  these management and coordination mechanisms.}

Key personnel for this work will include the two co-PIs, four PhD
students with varying background and interests, one staff engineer,
and several undergraduate interns and Master's students.
Figure~\ref{fig:workplan} sketches our envisaged mapping of tasks onto
PhD dissertations, with a rough timeline indicating a natural ordering
of the tasks.  Figure~\ref{fig:roles} provides more detail on
supporting effort and supervision.

\forreaders{This section needs more text, but we've worked pretty hard
on the tables.  Your feedback is appreciated!}

\subsection*{Principal Investigator Roles}

The PIs are well positioned to co-lead an effort whose success
requires deep contributions from both PL and HCI.  Andrew Head
recently co-founded a new HCI group at the University of Pennsylvania
and specializes in interactive programming environments, while
Benjamin Pierce has published widely on PL topics---including, for the
past several years, the theory and practice of PBT.  Head and Pierce
already have an established collaboration, with two jointly supervised
PhD students (Harrison Goldstein, who is leading the Jane Street
interview study, and Jessica Shi, who is developing a project around
user interfaces for proof assistants).

The proposed project will be a main focus for both PIs during the
whole five years.  Two summer months are allocated to each PI for this
reason.  Formally, PI Head will supervise the two HCI-focused PhD
students, while PI Pierce will supervise the two PL-related students
and the engineer.

\ROLE{Ph.D. 1}{Advisor PI Head}{Foundations}{The first Ph.D. student
  will develop foundational knowledge to support the human-centered
  design and development of PBT tools. This work will begin with
  defining a preliminary theory of PBT on the basis of our studies to
  date, with a set of falsifiable hypotheses about how tooling
  supports PBT. Then, the student will conduct a survey to expand and
  generalize our understanding of barriers, conduct critical
  comparative studies of existing PBT solutions, and assist in the
  conduct of formative observational studies related to tool-building
  efforts. \underconstruction{Explain how much work these studies are!}
}{Qualitative HCI}

\ROLE{Ph.D. 2}{Advisor PI Pierce}{Generation}{The second Ph.D.
student
will develop the PL theory necessary to enable new classes of powerful PBT
generation tools. Central to this Ph.D. will be the advancement of work on
reflective generators, a powerful abstraction for producing random data, with
potential to support tunability of distributions and sophisticated shrinking
techniques. This student will also develop a benchmark suite supporting the
head-to-head comparison of PBT technologies developed in PL. Further efforts
will involve the assessment of the usability of reflective output with the
assistance of HCI Ph.D. student 1, and the improvement of language design for
generator automation.}{PL Theory}

\ROLE{Ph.D. 3}{Advisor PI Pierce}{Specification}{The third Ph.D. student
will advance programming languages for specification. Their goal will be to
enhance the expressiveness and understandability of specifications. Their work
will begin by making specification languages more powerful by supporting
formulation of properties across module boundaries, and the more efficient
specification of model-based properties. They will then explore how to improve
the walk-up-and-use experience of specification languages by building tools for
mixed-initiative property specification and understanding the meaning of
properties. Their work will conclude with developing technology for for
converting between property-based specifications into singular test-case
specifications to serve as regression tests.}{PL Language Design}

\ROLE{Ph.D. 4}{Advisor PI Head}{Interaction}{The fourth Ph.D. student
will design, implement, and evaluate interactive views that provide programmers
with powerful controls for influencing testing effectiveness. They will first
develop tools that support the live viewing and analysis of complex
distributions of generated data. Then, drawing on the reflective generator
technology developed by Ph.D. 2, they will introduce controls that allow
programmers to influence the behavior of generators through direct manipulation
of generated data. The Ph.D.  student will also design tools that support the
understanding of individual inputs with novel features for interactive shrinking
and debugging. Select views will be brought together and refined to make testing
dashboards suitable for monitoring the outcomes of random PBT tests in
professional software development
settings.}{HCI Systems}

% \ROLE{PhD 1}{Advisor PI Pierce}{Reflecting on Random Generation}{This PhD student will focus on reflective generators, a powerful abstraction for producing random data. They will finish developing the theoretical abstraction and then continue by working closely with our staff engineer to implement and evaluate testing tools that rely on reflective generators as a foundation. This student will also work with undergraduate students to implement orthogonal testing tools.}{PL, Some HCI}

% \ROLE{PhD 2}{Advisor PI Head}{Human-Centered Foundations of Property-Based Testing}{This PhD student will develop a robust theory of property-based testing from a user-centered perspective. They will start by finishing ongoing work with Jane Street. Then they will do further foundational studies to understand finer-grained aspects of PBT usability and make recommendations for the design of future PBT tools and curricula.}{HCI, Some PL}

% \ROLE{PhD 3}{Advisors PI Head and PI Pierce}{"In Your Face" Property-Based Testing}{This PhD student will build tools for PBT that integrate the testing process into a programmer's editing environment. They will use human-centered methods to design and implement tools that users will actually see value in, and they will significantly increase the potential adoption of PBT by putting it easily within reach.}{HCI, PL}

% \ROLE{PhD 4}{Advisors PI Head and PI Pierce}{Teaching Lightweight Formal Methods}{This PhD student will approach PBT from the perspective of an educator, asking how students and industry professionals can better succeed at learning to use the tools involved. They will develop curricula for teaching PBT, and they will also ask more fundamental questions about how users understand executable properties. This work will dove-tail with ongoing work at Penn about human-centered aspects of other kinds of properties (e.g., theorems in proof assistants).}{Education, Some PL, Some HCI}

\subsection*{Research Engineer Role}

\ROLE{Engineer}{Supervisors PI Head and PI Pierce}{Property-Based Testing in the Wild}{Many of the aforementioned projects include or would benefit from technology transfer activities that bring research ideas into practice. Our staff engineer will assist with this transfer, interfacing with existing open source communities to maintain, improve, and popularize frameworks for PBT in a number of popular programming languages. This will include, but not be limited to: implementing reflective generators in existing frameworks, improving library designs as per recommendations from PhD 2, maintaining the tools produced by PhD 3, etc.}{Engineering}

\subsection*{Timeline}

The work of the project will take place over the course of five years.
Figure~\ref{fig:workplan} offers best guesses for natural starting and
completion time for the various project tasks, colored according to
which PhD student (or, in a few cases, the engineer or faculty) should
lead each task.

Two PhD students and the engineer will be recruited during the first
year, and two more students in the second year.  Work at the beginning
of the project will focus on deepending our foundational understanding
of opportunities and challenges for PBT, on extending and enriching
our past research work on generators, and on building and
disseminating tools based on this work.  Starting in the second year,
we will spin up efforts in specification tools and user-interface
experiments and begin constructing the \tyche{} IDE.  The latter years
of the project will introduce additional foundational studies and
infrastructure-building projects, but will emphasize more and more the
knowledge- and technology-transfer elements of the project.
Undergraduate education will be a continuous thread throughout the
project.

% \iflater
% \bcp{Here's some old test, but I think it needs to be
%   rewritten... it should basically narrate the timeline figure as it
%   now stands, year by year.  Indeed, we could have paragraphs labeled
%   ``Year 1,'' etc.}

% Early efforts will focus on strengthening foundations and
% motivations---in particular, strengthening and generalizing the
% findings from our need-finding research to-date. Also beginning in
% year 1, we will develop PL techniques for which we have strong
% motivation, and which will form the backbone of later interactive
% systems. This includes the development of reflective generators,
% shrinkers, and fuzzers.  \todolast{Not sure whether to include this:
%   Initially, these efforts will be led by PhD candidate Harrison
%   Goldstein, who has developed the preliminary work in these areas
%   cited in the proposal.}

% HCI-based tool-building will begin in earnest in year 2, once the
% foundations have been established. This will take place in parallel
% with observations of developers undertaking PBT for the particular
% tasks the tools are meant to support. Some of these projects, most
% notably the ability to tune data distributions, will require tight
% coordination between the PL and HCI student.  Other projects,
% including tooling for evaluating data distributions and and
% counterexamples as regression tests, are less tightly coupled.

% Educational initiatives will take place throughout the project. PBT
% instruction will be incorporated into the data science classroom in
% the first year, and iteratively improved after reviewing course
% outcomes in each successive year. Our efforts to teach developers when
% to leverage properties will occur mostly in the first two
% years\todolater{doesn't match the figure} in
% parallel with our formative research. Tool-building for the classroom
% will take place in the final two years, after we have established a
% strong instructional core for teaching PBT at Penn.

\subsection*{Coordination Mechanisms}

The main coordination mechanism for the project will be weekly group
meetings for the entire project team---PIs, PhD students, staff
engineer, undergraduates and masters students.
%
Each PI will also meet weekly with the two PhD students working under
their primary supervision (Figure~\ref{fig:roles}).
%
Slack and email will be used for daily team communications.  Git will
be used for software development and writing.

Given the cross-disciplinary nature of the project agenda, it will be
important for all team members to have an appreciation of key methods
and conceptual tools from both PL and HCI.  The four PhD students will
be encouraged to take both Penn's core PL theory course (CIS 5000,
{\em Software Foundations}), and our new PhD-level HCI course (CIS
5120, {\em Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction}).

\todolater{Anything else?}

\subsection*{Project Management Budget}

Since all team members will have offices in the same building on
Penn's campus, we do not envisage any significant costs specifically
associated with management and coordination.

\subsection*{Success Metrics}

One major benefit of
HCI methodologies is that they are self-validating---tools are built with users
in the loop and evaluated in user studies before being shipped to the public.
Each tool-building project we complete will include design justifications and
evaluation based on user feedback, and many of the more theoretical projects will
be measured by their ability to support the user-facing tools.

We also plan to verify that our improvements to the ecosystem for PBT
actually drive increased adoption. For this, we reach for an
admittedly somewhat arbitrary metric: downloads of our \tyche{} IDE.
We will list the IDE on the Visual Studio Code extension marketplace,
with a goal of reaching 60,000 downloads by the end of the project. At
the time of writing, this would put \tyche{} in the top 10 extensions
tagged ``Testing'' that are not either full language servers or Large
Language Model interfaces~\cite{noauthor_testing_nodate}, a lofty but,
we believe, eminently achievable goal.

Success of our educational efforts will also be measured by uptake: We
will advertise our PBT course materials in educational circles
(directly to friends and colleagues and indirectly through a paper
submitted to the CS in Education conference), aiming to see them used
by courses in at least 10 universities by the end of the project.

\todolast{Any other educational metrics?  Docs, etc.?}

Finally, the success of the more foundation project threads can, as
usual, be measured at least partly in publications.  We will target
top venues in PL, HCI, and Software Engineering, e.g., ICFP, PLDI,
OOPSLA, ICSE, HCI, and UIST.
